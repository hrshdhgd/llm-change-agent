    Some "metastatic malignant neoplasms" are defined as "secondary neoplasms", "metastatic
    malignant neoplasm in the lymph nodes" is defined as "neoplasm". Cancers currently
    only include "neoplasms", but not "secondary neoplasms" which means that some
    "metastatic malignant neoplasms" are not cancers, while "metastatic malignant
    neoplasm in the lymph nodes" is. The textual definitions for some cancers also

    \ disorder with anti-MOG antibodies (MONDO:0035664)  \nFrom the same source: \"\
    The MOG antibodies were initially detected primarily in a subgroup of patients\
    \ with acute/multiphasic demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM/MDEM) (2, 3). Subsequent\
    \ studies showed that MOG antibodies were also present in patients with optic\
    \ neuritis, myelitis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) phenotype\
    \ without aquaporin 4 (AQP4) antibodies, and brainstem and cerebral cortical encephalitis;\
    \ Recently, the international diagnostic criteria for MOGAD were published (12),\
    \ and the diagnosis of MOGAD is now made based on the presence of at least one\
    \ of the core clinical demyelinating events (optic neuritis, myelitis, ADEM, cerebral\
    \ monofocal or polyfocal deficits, brainstem or cerebellar deficits, and cerebral\
    \ cortical encephalitis often with seizures), a positive MOG-IgG test, and the\
    \ exclusion of alternative diagnoses including MS.\"\nSee also: MOGAD is now recognized\
    \ as an autonomous, antibody-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disorder, most\
    \ frequently with relapsing course and a variety of clinical manifestations. As\
    \ it is a rare condition, researchers should still focus on the different aspects\
    \ of the disease: its pathophysiological mechanisms, the identification of markers\
    \ of the disease status and outcome, the incidence in various regions and patients\
    \ populations. All of the above should form the basis for development and elaboration\

    ### Definition

    Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is a rare cause of stroke in the general population;
    however, represents one of the more common causes of stroke in patients younger
    than 45 years of age. Its signs and symptoms can be vague, and diagnosis can be
    elusive. Spontaneous dissections have been reported. However, incidental minor
    trauma often precipitates this potentially dangerous condition. Often some neck
    distortion such as chiropractic manipulation, bending of the neck, or blunt trauma
    causes the dissection. The dissection of the artery may ultimately lead to a stroke
    which often can be delayed for days following the acute dissection.  Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441827/

    this condition listed at NORD.  Currently it is not listed in NORD and it is not
    in Orphanet either (I will write a ticket to them for their consideration). Orphanet
    does list familial cervical artery dissection  (note that cervical artery dissection
    occurs when there''s a tear in either a carotid or vertebral artery).  It is a
    rare condition.

- pr7948: "OMIA xrefs for non-human animal diseases\nSeveral issues to address regarding\
    \ OMIA terms:\n1. Design pattern for non-human animal diseases due to genetic\
    \ mutation. Patterns should be similar to human pattern (e.g. disease based on\
    \ anatomical entity). The terms with a \u201Ccross-species analog\u201D pattern\
    \ should inherit the human disease pattern (ie we should not need to add another\
    \ pattern). Need to bring NCBIGene into Mondo for this step.\n2. We are adding\
    \ more OMIA terms to Mondo to improve our coverage of non-human animal diseases.\
    \ In order to do some testing, I have compared the OMIA SQL dump from 2023-02-09\
    \ (our original source of OMIA information) to 2023-12-15. I note that there are\
    \ several OMIA terms where the name has changed. Please see [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BKfnDKSn7t8kEEC1ulijGG2FPYWUAi_Nb6FdJp79mlA/edit#gid=0)\
    \ which is sorted for OMIA terms that are to be included in Mondo and have had\
    \ name changes. \nTo avoid confusion for users who use these Mondo-OMIA mappings\
    \ and ensure that these mappings are stable and can be trusted, we would like\
    \ to bring this issue to your attention and suggest solutions. \nOption 1: OMIA\
    \ does not reuse IDs to refer to different concepts. If a concept changes, the\
    \ OMIA ID would be obsoleted, and a new ID would be given (similar to SOP for\
    \ ontologies). This will ensure that our Mondo-OMIA mappings will always be correct\
    \ since they will always be in sync. However, we recognize that a proliferation\
    \ of IDs might be problematic, and OMIA existing records need to be updated frequently\
    \ as more specific gene-disease linkages are discovered in non-human animals.\n\
    Option 2: OMIA creates a file that includes these \"renamings\" (OMIA ID, the\
    \ previous name, and the new name), and publishes this file with every release.\
    \ This will help us with keeping the Mondo-OMIA mappings up to date during synchronization.\n\
    3. We were wondering whether you would consider implementing some kind of persistent\
    \ URL scheme for OMIA. Right now, the URL for \u2018hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,\
    \ domestic cat\u2019 OMIA:000515-9685 is https://omia.org/OMIA000515/9685/ . The\
    \ best practice is to not append characters onto the local ID in the URL (e.g\
    \ the final \u2018/\u2019 character). This will aid in linking OMIA database xref\
    \ terms in Mondo to the correct OMIA page. Currently, if you view the Mondo term\
    \ for  \u2018hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, domestic cat\u2019 [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/mondo/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FMONDO_1010459)\
    \ and then click on the link for the OMIA db-xref, you will get a page not found\
    \ error due to the final \u2018/\u2019. \nIdeally, \n-The URL should be permanent\
    \ (persistent). When the website changes domain, the identifiers/URIs of the OMIA\
    \ term stay the same, and still resolve. \n-The suffix, or remainder, of the PURL\
    \ should be the ID. Would it be possible to make sure that https://omia.org/OMIA000515/9685/\
    \ resolves to the same page as https://omia.org/OMIA000515/9685 (without the final\

- pr7804: "OMIA xrefs for non-human animal diseases\nSeveral issues to address regarding\
    \ OMIA terms:\n1. Design pattern for non-human animal diseases due to genetic\
    \ mutation. Patterns should be similar to human pattern (e.g. disease based on\
    \ anatomical entity). The terms with a \u201Ccross-species analog\u201D pattern\
    \ should inherit the human disease pattern (ie we should not need to add another\
    \ pattern). Need to bring NCBIGene into Mondo for this step.\n2. We are adding\
    \ more OMIA terms to Mondo to improve our coverage of non-human animal diseases.\
    \ In order to do some testing, I have compared the OMIA SQL dump from 2023-02-09\
    \ (our original source of OMIA information) to 2023-12-15. I note that there are\
    \ several OMIA terms where the name has changed. Please see [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BKfnDKSn7t8kEEC1ulijGG2FPYWUAi_Nb6FdJp79mlA/edit#gid=0)\
    \ which is sorted for OMIA terms that are to be included in Mondo and have had\
    \ name changes. \nTo avoid confusion for users who use these Mondo-OMIA mappings\
    \ and ensure that these mappings are stable and can be trusted, we would like\
    \ to bring this issue to your attention and suggest solutions. \nOption 1: OMIA\
    \ does not reuse IDs to refer to different concepts. If a concept changes, the\
    \ OMIA ID would be obsoleted, and a new ID would be given (similar to SOP for\
    \ ontologies). This will ensure that our Mondo-OMIA mappings will always be correct\
    \ since they will always be in sync. However, we recognize that a proliferation\
    \ of IDs might be problematic, and OMIA existing records need to be updated frequently\
    \ as more specific gene-disease linkages are discovered in non-human animals.\n\
    Option 2: OMIA creates a file that includes these \"renamings\" (OMIA ID, the\
    \ previous name, and the new name), and publishes this file with every release.\
    \ This will help us with keeping the Mondo-OMIA mappings up to date during synchronization.\n\
    3. We were wondering whether you would consider implementing some kind of persistent\
    \ URL scheme for OMIA. Right now, the URL for \u2018hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,\
    \ domestic cat\u2019 OMIA:000515-9685 is https://omia.org/OMIA000515/9685/ . The\
    \ best practice is to not append characters onto the local ID in the URL (e.g\
    \ the final \u2018/\u2019 character). This will aid in linking OMIA database xref\
    \ terms in Mondo to the correct OMIA page. Currently, if you view the Mondo term\
    \ for  \u2018hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, domestic cat\u2019 [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/mondo/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FMONDO_1010459)\
    \ and then click on the link for the OMIA db-xref, you will get a page not found\
    \ error due to the final \u2018/\u2019. \nIdeally, \n-The URL should be permanent\
    \ (persistent). When the website changes domain, the identifiers/URIs of the OMIA\

    Primary mast cell activation syndrome MONDO:0100005

    **Reason for deprecation**

    Based on the definition and trying to map to UMLS, I think this is conceptually
    equivalent with the Orphanet term on the MONDO entry below.

    The SNOMEDCT definition on UMLS C4267893 is very similar to the orphanet term
    (also mapped to this CUI)  "A rare haematologic disease characterised by symptoms
    of mast cell activation in the absence of cutaneous findings, as well as absence
    of diagnostic criteria of systemic mastocytosis with tryptase levels of less than
    20 mg/ml and normal to low burden of mast cells. Bone marrow biopsy reveals the
    presence of monoclonal mast cells carrying the KIT D816V mutation and/or expressing
    CD25. Symptoms include recurrent episodes of flushing, headache, hypotension,
    abdominal cramping, nausea, diarrhoea, cardiac arrhythmia, bronchoconstriction
    and bleeding diathesis. (SNOMEDCT_US)"  [1260202003]

    UMLS has no match for "primary mast cell activation syndrome" but based on the
    definition and PMID citation, the intent for the Mondo record seems to be MCAS
    with and underlying molecular pertubation in the KIT gene.

    Note also the synonym on  MONDO:0100005 has a typo (it is current "primary _MACS_"
    but I think it should be _MCAS_ ?)

    \ Curation Expert Panel. Our panel believes that the term \"inborn error of surfactant\
    \ metabolism\" should replace \"hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis\" as\
    \ it is a more accurate parent term for the hereditary surfactant related diseases\
    \ that reside under it in the disease ontology tree. \nAttached is an image to\
    \ clarify our request to replace the term \"hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis\"\
    \ with \"inborn error of surfactant metabolism\" and move this parent term and\
    \ the gene related syndromes beneath it to the parent term \"interstitial lung\
    \ disease\". Please disregard the part of this image showing \"interstitial lung\
    \ disease due to SFTPB dysfunction\" as a term; we will submit a separate request\
    \ to introduce that term. \n![update](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/assets/152438755/f72c62a8-5ec0-4b17-b723-1879f3499b38)"

    **_Optional_: Any additional information (like supporting evidence, PubMed ID,\
    \ etc.)**\nHello, my name is Emily Brown Reeves, and I am a curator for ClinGen's\
    \ IEM GCEP. I just finished the curation of PHKB, in which deleterious mutations\
    \ cause GSD 9B in an autosomal recessive manner. Before we publish the curation,\
    \ we'd like to suggest a relabel for the MONDO label based on my recent curation.\
    \ I've included the summary below which includes evidence to support the suggested\
    \ changes.\nThe gene PHKB which codes for subunit b of Phosphorylase b kinase\
    \ (Phk) has been definitively associated with Glycogen Storage Disease 9B (GSD\
    \ 9B or GSD IXB) according to the gene-disease validity curation process (Standard\
    \ Operating Procedures Version 10) of ClinGen.\nContext for PHKB: Phk\u2019s functional\
    \ role is to activate glycogen phosphorylase through phosphorylation. Glycogen\
    \ phosphorylase hydrolyzes glycogen thereby releasing free glucose for utilization\
    \ under fasting conditions. Therefore improper activation of glycogen phosphorylase\
    \ can result in glycogen buildup in the liver, hypoglycemia, exercise intolerance\
    \ and progressive muscle weakness. The hexadecameric structure of Phk is created\
    \ by the association of four copies of each of the \u03B1-, \u03B2-, \u0263-,\
    \ and \u03B4-subunits. The regulatory subunits are \u03B1, \u03B2 and \u03B4,\
    \ while \u0263 contains the active site. Subunit \u03B1 is encoded PHKA1 and PHKA2\
    \ are found on the X-chromosome and encode the muscle and liver isoform of the\
    \ subunit. Pathogenic mutations in PHKA2 cause the most frequent type of glycogen\
    \ storage disease 9. PHKB is found on chromosome 16 and can be alternatively spliced\
    \ to produce tissue isoforms. PHKG1 and PHKG2 encode the muscle and liver isoforms\
    \ of \u0263, respectively, and are found on chromosomes 7 and 16. Mutations in\
    \ PHKG1 and PHKG2 are associated with the more severe version GSD 9c. CALM1, CALM2,\
    \ and CALM3 are three separate genes that encode the \u03B4 subunit. Mutations\
    \ in these genes have not been linked to the disease. Phk has widespread tissue\
    \ distribution but primarily causes disease in the liver and muscle.\nPHKB performs\
    \ a regulatory role in Phk and is similar to the \u03B1 subunit. In an autosomal\
    \ recessive manner mutations in this subunit have been associated with hepatomegaly,\
    \ hypoglycemia only after prolonged fasting and in some cases mild muscle hypotonia\
    \ and growth retardation. Manifestation can be highly variable ranging from mild\
    \ to aggressive.(PMID: 33858366) The average age of onset is 3.8 years.(PMID:\
    \ 33858366) Most all patients present with hepatomegaly and elevated hepatic transaminase.\
    \ Less than half of reported cases have reported hypoglycemia.(PMID: 33858366)\
    \ And only about 15% of cases report short stature. Liver cirrhosis has also been\
    \ reported in one case.(PMID: 33858366) Most variants reported to date affect\
    \ primarily the liver with no symptoms of muscle involvement being reported. While\
    \ symptoms improve with age, individuals should be monitored life-long for complications\
    \ such as liver fibrosis. There is a predominance of severe, null mutations (nonsense,\

- pr7227: 'Review request: 56 clingen preferred synonyms classified as "narrow"

    After our meeting with ClinGen, I am trying to put together a Mondo subset for
    ClinGen which we can load into Monarch OLS, and which gives the ClinGen data engineers
    a way to render Mondo information with the ClinGen preferred labels.

    While building my draft, I noticed that current 55 synonyms preferred by ClinGen
    are considered "narrow" in Mondo. My questions are the following:

    1. Should these 55 be really considered "narrow"

    2. If so, is it not somewhat risky to "swap" them out during the subset generation
    process, as "narrow" implies as somewhat different conceptual extent of the Mondo
    class?

    \ \u201CRAB18 deficiency is the molecular deficit underlying both Warburg micro\
    \ syndrome (characterized by eye, nervous system, and endocrine abnormalities)\
    \ and Martsolf syndrome (characterized by similar \u2013 but milder \u2013 findings).\
    \ To date Warburg micro syndrome comprises >96% of reported individuals with genetically\
    \ defined RAB18 deficiency. The hallmark ophthalmologic findings are bilateral\
    \ congenital cataracts, usually accompanied by microphthalmia, microcornea (diameter\
    \ <10), and small atonic pupils. Poor vision despite early cataract surgery likely\
    \ results from progressive optic atrophy and cortical visual impairment. Individuals\
    \ with Warburg micro syndrome have severe to profound intellectual disability\
    \ (ID); those with Martsolf syndrome have mild to moderate ID. Some individuals\
    \ with RAB18 deficiency also have epilepsy. In Warburg micro syndrome, a progressive\
    \ ascending spastic paraplegia typically begins with spastic diplegia and contractures\
    \ during the first year, followed by upper-limb involvement leading to spastic\
    \ quadriplegia after about age five years, often eventually causing breathing\
    \ difficulties. In Martsolf syndrome infantile hypotonia is followed primarily\
    \ by slowly progressive lower-limb spasticity. Hypogonadism \u2013 when present\
    \ \u2013 manifests in both syndromes, in males as micropenis and/or cryptorchidism\
    \ and in females as hypoplastic labia minora, clitoral hypoplasia, and small introitus.\u201D\

    steatohepatitis or NASH) is a type of fatty liver disease. It often develops due
    to a metabolic disorder, such as obesity or diabetes, resulting in a toxic buildup
    of fat in the liver. It is the most severe form of [metabolic dysfunction-associated
    steatotic liver disease](https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-dangerous-is-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-2223390)
    (MASLD, formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD).

    ### Synonym type

    None

    ### Definition

    Benign essential blepharospasm is a condition characterized by abnormal blinking
    or spasms of the eyelids. Symptoms may begin as eye twitching and blinking and
    there may be symptoms of eye irritation. Eventually, BEB causes involuntary closure
    of the eyes. The exact cause of BEB is unknown. Susceptibility to benign essential
    blepharospasm may be associated with a microsatellite marker to the dopamine receptor
    DRD5 gene. The disorder is one of a group of disorders collectively known as adult-onset
    focal dystonia. Benign essential blepharospasm is different from the common, temporary
    eyelid twitching that can be caused by fatigue, stress, or caffeine. Treatment
    of BEB consists of oral drug therapy, focal injections of botulinum toxin (four
    different brands are available in the USA) or surgery to remove eyelid muscle.

    **Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria MONDO:0011738**

    **Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP) is a descriptive term reflecting
    increased gyral folding in the frontoparietal regions as determined by magnetic
    resonance imaging. It has subsequently been shown to represent a cobblestone malformation
    on histopathology. BFPP typically presents with hypotonia, developmental delay,
    moderate to severe intellectual disability, pyramidal signs, epileptic seizures,
    non-progressive cerebellar ataxia, deconjugate gaze, and/or strabismus. **

    **Mondo term (ID and Label)**

    MONDO:0001153, gender dysphoria

    **Reason for deprecation**

    Gender dysphoria is not considered a disease but rather a diagnostic term used
    to describe the distress an individual may experience when their gender identity
    differs from their assigned sex at birth. The removal of the term "disorder" reflects
    a more contemporary understanding and recognition of gender diversity and seeks
    to reduce the stigmatization of individuals with gender incongruence.

    Alternatively, changing the definition to reflect the diagnostic nature of the
    term, might be ok?

    OMIM has recently created an entry that uses "Cree Leukoencephalopathy" as an

    name on MONDO:0020507 (we have to have unique names for submissions to ClinVar

    \ BCL10 Deficiency\nORCID ID:\n0000-0002-4455-3112\n**_Optional_: Any additional\
    \ information (like supporting evidence, PubMed ID, etc.)**\nBCL10 was first reported\
    \ in relation to autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency in 2014 (Torres\
    \ et al., PMID: 25365219). Three variants (nonsense and splice donor) that have\
    \ been reported in 3 probands in 3 publications are included in this curation\
    \ (PMIDs: 25365219, 32008135, 34868072). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears\
    \ to be loss of function. Individuals affected with combined immunodeficiency\
    \ due to BCL10 deficiency present in infancy with severe, recurrent infections.\
    \ While more evidence is needed to establish the full phenotype, patients reported\
    \ to date have normal total T cell counts but a deficit of memory T cells combined\
    \ with impaired effector T cell functions, hypogammaglobulinemia, and decreased\
    \ memory B cells. Low counts of other T cell subsets and NK cells have been described.\
    \ Heterozygous carriers are reported as unaffected (PMID: 25365219, 34868072).\n\
    This gene-disease association is supported by biochemical studies, protein interactions,\
    \ functional and rescue assays, as well as animal models (PMIDs: 10400625, 24074955,\
    \ 25365219, 32008135, 11163238, 12910267). BCL10 is a part of the CARD11/9\u2013\
    BCL10\u2013MALT1 (CBM) complex. It acts as a signaling molecule transducing the\
    \ triggering of cell surface antigen receptors to NF-kappaB activation (PMID:\
    \ 10400625, 24074955). We have previously established other genes within this\
    \ complex including CARD11 as definitively associated with severe combined immune\
    \ deficiency. Affected patient cells show altered NF-kappaB signaling that is\
    \ rescued by wild type (PMID: 25365219, 32008135). BCL10 knockout mice have B\
    \ cell lymphopenia, reduced B cell proliferation, hypogammaglobulinemia, and impaired\
    \ immune responses consistent with combined immunodeficiency (PMID: 11163238,\
    \ 12910267).\nIn summary, BCL10 is definitively associated with combined immunodeficiency\
    \ due to BCL10 deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research\
    \ and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification\
    \ was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID GCEP on the meeting date of December 15,\

    juvenile cataract-microcornea-renal glucosuria syndrome

    **Bug/Typo/Error description**

    This term is inferred to be an inherited kidney disorder, as are tons of other
    "wrong" assertions. Could we discuss what the problem is, I am completely confused.

    For some reason, I did not see this and it makes the branch I was working on difficult
    to merge. However, the majority of the assertions are probably things we do not
    want here. I cannot start fixing this without understanding where the false inferences
    are coming from.

    Honestly it is not easy to work on this if key assertions like this are left only
    to the reasoner -- it is not possible to move things around in the inferred view.
    The inference that is done in this way will tend to make a completely flat hierarchy
    under inherited kidney disorder, and this is just not very useful. Can we do this
    in another way? I have no idea how to combine both methods.

    I think I need to abort the branch I am working on @matentzn @cmungall is there

    associated with infantile period seizures, complete or nearly-complete seizure
    remission afterwards, usually good developmental outcome, and dominant transmission
    with high penetrance in pedigrees.  For most affected infants, seizures begin
    within the first week after term birth.  In a minority, however, seizures can
    begin after the first week but within the first several months of life.  At onset,
    seizures may be highly recurrent, and often feature unilateral tonic limb stiffening
    that may alternate sides from seizure to seizure, accompanied by cyanosis and
    autonomic features.  Limb shaking movements occur, but not in the evolving rhythmic
    pattern of tonic-clonic convulsions in older individuals. Neurological examination
    of the infant is normal between seizures. Although these seizures remit by 4-12
    months of age in the majority, 15-30% of those affected have one or more seizure
    recurrences later, including febrile seizures, focal-onset seizures, and convulsions.  Although
    most affected children show normal subsequent development, individuals with mild
    learning difficulties have been reported in families where the majority develop
    typically.

- pr6054: "Ontology for disorders cased by variants in PSAP\nHello - I am using the\

    \ the PSAP gene is associated with 4 different conditions (described below;  (https://www.omim.org/entry/176801?search=PSAP&highlight=psap).\
    \ Based on clear differences in molecular mechanism as well as the clinical and\
    \ biochemical phenotypes, with clusters of variants in the different Saposins\
    \ that are generated by the precursor (prosaposin, encoded by PSAP), the ClinGen\
    \ Lysosomal Diseases Gene Curation Expert Panel is requesting the following changes.\
    \ See attached slides for details of publications and summary of Mondo request\
    \ on Slide 22. Thank you!\n[PSAP.pptx](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/files/10910422/PSAP.pptx)\n\
    1) Please generate a new term \"PSAP-related sphingolipidosis\" under the parent\
    \ term \"Sphingolipidosis\" (MONDO:0019255).\nDescription: A sphingolipidosis\
    \ caused by variants in the PSAP gene. Clinical and biochemical features vary\
    \ based on the location of variants within the gene and their molecular impact.\n\
    2a) Please move \"atypical Gaucher disease due to saposin C deficiency\" (MONDO:0012517)\
    \ from underneath the parent term \"Gaucher disease\" (MONDO:0018150) to under\
    \ the new parent term \"PSAP-related sphingolipidosis\". The rationale for this\
    \ request is that \"Atypical Gaucher disease due to saposin C deficiency\" (MONDO:0012517)\
    \ is caused by variants in PSAP, while all of the other subtypes of Gaucher disease\
    \ that fall under the Gaucher disease (MONDO:0018150) parent are caused by variants\
    \ in GBA. \n2b) Please relabel \"atypical Gaucher disease due to saposin C deficiency\"\
    \ (MONDO:0012517) as \"Gaucher disease due to saposin C deficiency\". \n3a) Please\
    \ move \"Krabbe disease, atypical, due to saposin A deficiency\" (MONDO:0012720)\
    \ under the new \"PSAP-related sphingolipidosis\" term. \n3b) Please relabel as\
    \ \"Krabbe disease, atypical, due to Saposin A deficiency\" as \"\"Krabbe disease\
    \ due to saposin A deficiency\" We are requesting removal of \"atypical\" because\
    \ clinical features are very similar.\n4a) Please move \"metachromatic leukodystrophy\
    \ due to saposin b deficiency\" (MONDO:0009590) to underneath \"PSAP-related sphingolipidosis\"\
    .\n4b) Under \"Metachromatic leukodystrophy\" (MONDO:0018868), please delete the\
    \ term \"metachromatic leukodystrophy, adult-onset, with normal arylsulfatase\
    \ A\" (MONDO:0007981). This appears to be derived from an old entry in OMIM -\
    \ no molecular details available. Another option would be to keep this term but\

    The term was made obsolete, but I think we want to keep it!

    With regard to removing **non-familial,** this is requested because self-limited
    familial epilepsies are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion (I have confirmed
    this with the group) and the cases in which the epilepsy is not seen throughout
    a pedigree are due to de novo cases of an autosomal dominant variant. These variants
    can thus still be inherited in future gerenerations and cause epilepsy despite
    a lack of history in the family. Therefore, "non-familial" is a misnomer and can
    cause unnecessary confusion.

    We are also requesting the change from "seizures" to "epilepsy" in this term because
    that is in-line with modern naming practices.

    Mondo has an annotation property `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo#excluded_subClassOf`.
    This issue is not about that term.

    There is an object property `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/excluded_subClassOf`

    \ in CAPN5. (ADNIV, VNRI, CAPN5-VR...)\n770791000 SNOMED CT (http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/SNOMEDCT/770791000\

    \ is \"A rare genetic vitreoretinal degeneration characterised by a slowly progressive\
    \ vitreoretinopathy with onset during the second or third decade of life. The\
    \ disease initially presents as autoimmune uveitis with reduction in the b-wave\
    \ on electroretinography, and progresses with development of photoreceptor degeneration,\
    \ vitreous haemorrhage, cystoid macular oedema, retinal neovascularisation, intraocular\
    \ fibrosis, secondary glaucoma, and retinal detachment leading to phthisis and\
    \ complete blindness. Caused by heterozygous mutation in the CAPN5 gene on chromosome\
    \ 11q14.\" So this looks like it belongs with OMIM 193235 (and thus Orpha 329211\
    \ goes here as well, it's 1:1 with the OMIM entry) The SNOMED code is on Autosomal\

    \ DOID 9719 www.ontobee.org/ontology/DOID?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_9719\

    **Definition (free text, please give PubMed ID, if applicable, in format PMID:#######)**\n\
    CHRNG-associated hypo-akinesia disorder of prenatal onset is a term used to describe\
    \ the spectrum of presentations resulting from biallelic protein-altering variation\
    \ in CHRNG.  CHRNG is a subunit of the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor (AChR),\
    \ which is present in skeletal muscle at the neuromuscular junction. CHRNG encodes\
    \ for the gamma subunit of AChR, which is present during fetal development, and\
    \ is gradually replaced by the epsilon subunit in the late fetal and perinatal\
    \ period and persists through adulthood (PMID:16826520).  Fetal AChR is critical\
    \ for establishing muscle-axon interface and neuromuscular junctions as well as\
    \ prenatal neuromuscular signal transduction.    \nInactivation of the receptor\
    \ during early development leads to prenatal hypo-akinesia; subsequent phenotypes\
    \ are a consequence of this hypo-akinesia and are thought to be dependent upon\
    \ timing and severity of the anomaly at the neuromuscular junction. A range of\
    \ phenotypes varying in severity (including both lethal and non-lethal presentations)\
    \ have been reported, but typically include joint contractures, pterygia, dysmorphic\
    \ features, vertebral and thoracic anomalies, and additional variable abnormalities.\
    \ There are no clear genotype-phenotype correlations between the lethal and non-lethal\
    \ presentations of this spectrum; both inter- and intra-familial variability have\
    \ been reported, with the same variants being observed in both lethal and non-lethal\
    \ cases (PMIDs: 30868735, 22167768, 16826520, 16826531, etc.).\n**Parent term\

    In the literature, this syndrome is referred to as DeSanto-Shinawi syndrome. Additionally,
    patient support networks (https://www.dessh.org/) use the term DeSanto-Shinawi
    syndrome and have expressed concern about the negative connotation of the word
    "wack," which sounds the same as the current MonDO term.

    Additionally, the phrase "developmental delay" is not appropriate for individuals
    over the age of six. There are currently adults with intellectual disability who
    have DeSanto-Shinawi syndrome due to point mutations (PMID:25356899).

    has the disease in question? I realize OMIM does not like to retire entries, but

    than Q77.7)

    I would make ''congenital spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia'' a related synonym, not
    an exact synonym.

    ''congenital spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia'' just means a spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia
    of congenital onset, while ''Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia Congenita'' refers specifically
    to the COL2A1-related disorder with this name.

    \ gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive cases of Mainzer-Saldino\
    \ syndrome or the clinically overlapping Jeune syndrome in 2012 (Perrault et al.,\
    \ PMID: 22503633). Affected individuals with causal biallelic variants in IFT140\
    \ have since been identified in a number of other publications, with syndromic\
    \ cases most often referred to as short-rib thoracic dysplasia 9 with or without\
    \ polydactyly (PMID: 23418020), and non-syndromic cases typically diagnosed with\
    \ Leber congenital amaurosis or retinitis pigmentosa 80 (PMID: 26216056). Some\
    \ of the causal *IFT140* variants overlap between cases with different diagnoses,\
    \ and a single affected family can include both ocular and syndromic cases (PMID:\
    \ 26359340). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working\
    \ Group, we found the molecular mechanism (biallelic loss of function in the IFT140\
    \ gene product) and mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) to be consistent\
    \ among unrelated patients diagnosed with either short-rib thoracic dysplasia\
    \ 9 with or without polydactyly (MIM#: 266920), Leber congenital amaurosis, or\
    \ retinitis pigmentosa 80 (MIM#: 617781). The phenotypic variability between them\
    \ appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities.\
    \ Therefore, these cases have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred\
    \ to as IFT140-related recessive ciliopathy.\"\n**Children terms (if applicable)**\
    \ Should any existing terms be re-classified as children underneath this new proposed\

    Ontology term: non-dystrophic myopathy (MONDO:0016110)

    Is defined

    A group of rare skeletal muscle ion-channel disorders caused by genetic mutations
    in the sodium and chloride channel genes. It is characterized by altered membrane
    excitability resulting in skeletal muscle stiffness. This group of myotonias is
    distinct from myotonic dystrophy because of the absence of systemic features or
    progressive weakness.

    But most of the descendants involve diseases that are not caused by mutations
    in sodium and ion channels

    For example

    autosomal dominant distal axonal motor neuropathy-myofibrillar myopathy syndrome
    (a yeast shock protein)

    autosomal dominant mitochondrial myopathy with exercise intolerance

    cap myopathy  (tropomyosin)

    It seems that the vitiligo tree could be improved.  My immediate comment is that
    this MIM number is not equivalent to vitiligo any more; we are working on making
    the correction at our end after having noticed that UMLS correctly split the concepts:

    which is where UMLS maps MeSH D016697, SCTID 21954000 (Herpes zoster auricularis,

- pr4981: 'short(-)rib(-)polydactyly syndrome type 3 and Verma-Naumoff names?

    I am trying to understand the nomenclature & differences/similarities between
    OMIM and OrphaNet as they related to these Mondo terms, the alternate names on
    these terms (and the names on the external sources) seem very similar:

    **MONDO:0019664;**  PREF name: short rib-polydactyly syndrome, Verma-Naumoff type

    exact syn: short rib-polydactyly syndrome type 3

    (This mondo term X-refs ORPHA:93271, which says OMIM 613091 is one of many OMIM
    concepts that map to the OrphaNet ID, so presumably this is a broader term?)

    **MONDO:0013127** PREF name: asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy 3

    Mondo exact syn: Verma-Naumoff syndrome

    OMIM PREF name: SHORT-RIB THORACIC DYSPLASIA 3 WITH OR WITHOUT POLYDACTYLY alt
    names: (from OMIM 613091) SHORT RIB-POLYDACTYLY SYNDROME, TYPE III (SRPS3) and
    VERMA-NAUMOFF SYNDROME (Is this an instance of OMIM using more generic descriptors
    in the alt names field to assist users who might want to find the more specific
    forms?)

    I would appreciate it if @ahamosh and @ana-rath-orphanet and their teams could
    take a look and help me understand this out so we can accurately represent these

    Microcephaly 6 with or without short stature\n**Synonyms**\nN/A\n**Definition\
    \ (free text, please give PubMed ID, if applicable, in format PMID:#######)**\n\
    Primary microcephaly refers to the clinical finding of a head circumference more\
    \ than than 3 standard deviations (SD) below the age- and sex-related mean, present\
    \ at birth. Primary microcephaly is a static developmental anomaly, distinguished\
    \ from secondary microcephaly, which refers to a progressive neurodegenerative\
    \ condition. Microcephaly is a disorder of fetal brain growth; individuals with\
    \ microcephaly have small brains and almost always have mental retardation, although\
    \ rare individuals with mild microcephaly (-3 SD) and normal intelligence have\
    \ been reported. Additional clinical features may include short stature or mild\
    \ seizures. These clinical features include Seckel syndrome, a rare autosomal\
    \ recessive disorder characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, dwarfism,\
    \ microcephaly with mental retardation, and a characteristic 'bird-headed' facial\
    \ appearance (Shanske et al., PMID: 9128935). MCPH is associated with a simplification\
    \ of the cerebral cortical gyral pattern and a slight reduction in the volume\
    \ of the white matter, consistent with the small size of the brain, but the architecture\
    \ of the brain in general is normal, with no evidence of a neuronal migration\
    \ defect (Woods et al., PMID: 15806441). Seckel syndrome 4 and autosomal recessive\
    \ primary microcephaly 6 are currently lumped together into one disease entity\
    \ per the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group,\
    \ while more published literature detailing Seckel syndrome 4 may support two\
    \ split disease entities in the future.\n**Parent term (use [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mondo),\

    \ ClinGen (Sheng-An Yang)\n**New term**: CDH1-Related Diffuse Gastric and Lobular\
    \ Breast Cancer\n**Syn**: DGLBC \n**Definition**: \nGermline pathogenic or likely\
    \ pathogenic variants in the CDH1 gene (NM_004360.5) predispose to hereditary\
    \ diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC; MIM# 137215), a cancer susceptibility syndrome\
    \ inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, initially characterized by the increased\
    \ risk for diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) but subsequently well documented to be\
    \ associated with lobular breast cancer (LBC) in women. To encompass the increased\
    \ risk for both DGC and LBC in the name of the CDH1 syndrome, the ClinGen Disease\
    \ Naming Committee and CDH1 Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) have proposed\
    \ to redefine the disease as CDH1-related Diffuse Gastric and Lobular Breast Cancer\
    \ Syndrome (DGLBCS). \n**Reference**. We are still submitting our manuscript which\
    \ contains the information of the new disease term (DGLBC). Since we expect this\
    \ paper will not be published soon, may we add reference after the paper gets\
    \ published?\n**Parent term**. The old disease term (Hereditary diffuse gastric\
    \ cancer, MONDO:0007648) is under these two parent terms: hereditary gastric cancer\
    \ (MONDO:0018502) and diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma (MONDO:0005017). However,\
    \ since many woman patients with CDH1 variants also have lobular breast cancer\
    \ (LBC), we think the old parent terms cannot well cover the new disease term\
    \ (DGLBC). Therefore, we are thinking that these two ways may solve this issue:\n\
    - Use all parent terms that related to DGLBC. So, we selected 4 parent terms for\

    \ not super helpful in determining a difference in these concepts,  but I am inclined\
    \ to agree these are distinct concepts. \nFrom what I have been able to find online,\
    \ it would seem that perhaps that 'myxoma' is the parent concept/class of tumor\
    \ _or_ a type of myxoid tumor that primarily presents in the heart (with 'myxoid'\
    \ phenotype characteristics being shared among all subtype) and 'angiomyxoma'\
    \ is a subtype that can be further described as superficial or deep/aggressive\
    \ but affects/involved blood vessels. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxoma and\
    \ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggressive_angiomyxoma and https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/other-conditions/angiomyxoma\n\
    noting that  UMLS has currently lumped these terms on the same CUI (C0027149),\
    \ possible following MeSH using Myxoma and angiomyxoma interchangeably? (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term=D009232\
    \ ) So I will follow up with them and request they split since NCIT and SNOMED\
    \ maintain separate codes for these concepts.\n**Your nano-attribution (ORCID)**\n\

    **Mondo term (ID and Label)**

    Antithrombin III deficiency MONDO:0013144

    **Reason for deprecation**

    This is an outdated term. There is no antithrombin I or II deficiency, so this
    should be referred to as antithrombin deficiency (PMID: 19141163, 31697819, 28317092,
    30005274); https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/hereditary-antithrombin-deficiency/;
    https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6148/hereditary-antithrombin-deficiency);
    https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/antithrombin-deficiency/.  However, there
    are type I (quantitative) and type II (qualitative) defects within antithrombin
    deficiency.  They are caused by different variants within the SERPINC1 gene, and
    should all be considered antithrombin deficiency.

    **Suggested term to consider**

    Antithrombin deficiency

    a subset of patterned macular dystrophy  (Orphanet:99001)

    It also has an exact synonym of patterned dystrophy of retinal pigment epithelium
    which makes it hard to distinguish from MONDO:0018973

- pr4493: "MONDO:0007064, adenosine deaminase deficiency - review?\nI am wondering\
    \ about MONDO:0007064, adenosine deaminase deficiency, This term seems to encompass\
    \ a lot of different concepts and it seems like these may need a split or some\
    \ descriptive clarification if they are all equivalent. There are two main issues\
    \ that I think are unclear at this point:\n1. Name \"adenosine deaminase deficiency\"\
    \ indicates the disease is primarily an enzyme deficiency, but [OMIM](https://omim.org/entry/102700)\
    \ and OrphaNet x-refs both use names that emphasize the \"severe combined immunodeficiency\"\
    \ aspect and then include \"ADA deficiency\" as a causative role. \nThis is kind\
    \ of picky, but there are other cases where the enzyme deficiency and the associated\
    \ clinical presentation are differentiated, so it may be helpful to clarify the\
    \ primary focus of this term on the disease presentation rather than the molecular/enzymatic\
    \ cause? Or separate out the clinical presentation(s) as children if the main\
    \ idea is the enzyme deficiency?\n2. [OMIM 102700](https://omim.org/entry/102700)\
    \ has the preferred and alternate names as follow: \n- severe combined immunodeficiency,\
    \ autosomal recessive, T cell-negative, B cell-negative, NK cell-negative, due\
    \ to adenosine deaminase deficiency \n- alternates:\n  - SCID DUE TO ADA DEFICIENCY\n\
    \  - ADA-SCID\n  - SCID DUE TO ADA DEFICIENCY, EARLY-ONSET \n- Included entities:\
    \  \n  - SCID DUE TO ADA DEFICIENCY, DELAYED ONSET \n  - SCID DUE TO ADA DEFICIENCY,\
    \ LATE-ONSET\n  - ADENOSINE DEAMINASE DEFICIENCY, PARTIAL\n  - PARTIAL ADA DEFICIENCY\n\
    This suggests the OMIM entry has two presentations: early onset ('classic') SCID\
    \ due to ADA deficiency and late-onset SCID due to partial ADA deficiency (thus\
    \ suggesting the complete deficiency is associate with the early onset?) But I'm\
    \ not sure if the Late onset is inherently equivalent to the partial enzyme deficiency\
    \ \n@ahamosh Can you weigh in on this? MeSH C531816 lumps the partial deficiency\
    \ and late onset, and thus so does UMLS for all of the 'included' terms on this\
    \ OMIM entry. But is a partial deficiency always/mostly associated with a later\
    \ onset enough to justify that lumping?"

    ORDO has SCID and non-SCID

    MHC class II deficiency is in the ns-CID branch rather than SCID:

    Others such as DO classify as a SCID:

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50745/58443779-09937d80-80a9-11e9-9e10-c5c38acbe598.png)

    As does NCIT:

    On the surface this appears to be a contribution. We might expect the two ORDO
    classes to be disjoint, and if we equivalenceify the NCIT and DOID by name we
    end up with a contradiction.

    We previously picked this up in the kboom analysis of this class here https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-disease-ontology-RETIRED/issues/181
    but didn''t follow up

    According to

    https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(14)00797-0/fulltext

    _Although MHC class II deficiency is not considered classical SCID according to
    the International Union of Immunological Societies classification criteria, patients
    usually present with clinical findings of typical CID. **..[snip]...** Comparing
    annual reports regarding the prevalence of the different subtypes of SCIDs revealed
    an approximately 5% frequency of MHC class II in the Canadian survey_

    Thus the term "SCID" can be considered ambiguous between "classic SCID" and "''general''
    SCID". This kind of semantic slippage is common and one of the challenges in aligning
    disease ontologies.

    Currently MONDO follows ORDO here. I would like to make labels and definitions
    clearer and to fix equivalence axioms. I think if people generally use SCID in
    the inclusive sense, then if we want a class for the classical strict sense then
    we should call that "classical SCID"

    It''s unclear if this is a Mendelian disease (it is not in OMIM) or if it is susceptibility
    towards IBD.

    Although there is this paper/case study (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26836588/)
    that says TRIM22 could be associated with very-early-onset IBD in one patient.

    **Suggested term to consider**

    http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0005265 ''inflammatory bowel disease''

    @ahamosh is this term under consideration for addition to OMIM or is there not
    enough evidence to call this a proper disease? Do you think we should consider
    classifying this as an ''inherited disease susceptibility?

    \ and reasons**\nI think this term (or at least the preferred name) should be\
    \ used for a grouping term to cover many concepts. MedGen mapping was running\
    \ into trouble with this Mondo ID and MONDO:0008097 (linear nevus sebaceous syndrome)\

    \ MeSH and OrphaNet that aren't really in agreement. I'm hoping the community\
    \ can review and each contributing database can amend their terms as needed.\n\
    According to NORD https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/epidermal-nevus-syndromes/\
    \ and DermNetNZ https://dermnetnz.org/topics/epidermal-naevus-syndromes, ENS is\
    \ a whole class of disorders, and LNSS/SCHIMMELPENNING-FEUERSTEIN-MIMS SYNDROME\
    \ is one subtype. \nAnd the X-refs for the Mondo concept left me with more questions\
    \ than clarity, unfortunately, these are the 'breadcrumbs' from trying to follow\

    \ SNOMED codes to this same CUI, which seems incorrect.)\nOrphanet:35125 | Epidermal\

    https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mondo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMONDO_0005365

    In the OLS link above, there is no entry for sensorineural hearing loss but its
    in the MONDO-Edit file

    Also the term "deafness" is used interchangeably throughout many of the entries
    under "hearing loss" but deafness is only profound hearing loss and does not encompass
    milder forms of hearing loss. So ideally the term "deafness" should be replaced
    with hearing loss as many of the forms of syndromic and nonsyndromic hearing loss
    do not have deafness, but milder hearing loss. This fix is also needed in OMIM
    and I''ve discussed with Ada'

    there are some problems here @nicolevasilevsky @kanems

    Guillain-Barre syndrome, familial (MONDO:0007691) -- there is a familial (Mendelian
    form) of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), see OMIM:139393. However, most cases are
    not Mendelian. The definition of the familial (Mendelian) form is this: A chronic
    monophasic, progressive or relapsing symmetric sensorimotor disorder characterized
    by progressive muscular weakness with impaired sensation, absent or diminished
    tendon reflexes and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins. However, this
    definition is appropriate for GBS in general and does not describe the Mendelian
    form. I would suggest adapting the deinition in OMIM if @ahamosh agrees.

    Def. A form of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurs in persons or families
    with a genetic predisposition to the acute or chronic forms of GBS. Note that
    GBS is considered to be a complex multifactorial disorder with both genetic and
    environmental factors, and families with clear Mendelian inheritance have been
    rarely reported: a mutation in the PMP22 gene (601097) on chromosome 17 was identified
    in a single family with the acute (AIDP) and chronic (CIDP) forms of inflammatory
    demyelinating polyneuropathy.

    -- This definition may need work, thoughts, @ahamosh'

    I am looking for clarification on congenital neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, MONDO:0008956
    Some of the X-refs are getting me a bit confused.

    -OMIM 214200 is a clinical description named "CEROID STORAGE DISEASE" alt name
    "LIPOFUSCIN STORAGE DISEASE" which doesn''t seem to be equivalent to congenital
    NCL (an "included in" term from OMIM 610127)

    -SNOMED 720830009 does say the preferred term is congenital neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis,
    but also says CLN-10/Cathepsin-D deficiency specific etiology are synonyms for
    that same SNOMED code/concept. Same with the MESH C566438 term. I appreciate the
    effort made the split CLN10 out from the generic concept of congenital NCL here,
    especially since so many other groups try to lump them.

    -FYI It looks like UMLS has term C1864670 for congenital NCL concept.

    -->It seems the MIM entry214200  might be best handled as a separate child concept
    of congenital NCL, maybe a sib to CLN-10?'

- pr3998: 'FAZIO-LONDE DISEASE vs Brown-Vialetto-van Laere syndrome

    https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/riboflavin-transporter-deficiency-neuronopathy

    Riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy encompasses two conditions that
    were once considered distinct disorders: Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS)
    and Fazio-Londe disease. The two conditions have similar signs and symptoms, but
    Fazio-Londe disease does not include sensorineural hearing loss. Because these
    two conditions share a genetic cause and have overlapping features, researchers
    determined that they are forms of a single disorder.

    name: progressive bulbar palsy

    def: "Progressive bulbar palsy involves the brain stem. The brain stem is the
    part of the brain needed for swallowing, speaking, chewing, and other functions.
    Signs and symptoms of progressive bulbar palsy include difficulty swallowing,
    weak jaw and facial muscles, progressive loss of speech, and weakening of the
    tongue. Additional symptoms include less prominent weakness in the arms and legs,
    and outbursts of laughing or crying (called emotional lability). Progressive bulbar
    palsy is considered a variant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Many
    people with progressive bulbar palsy later develop ALS. While there is no cure

    _updated 2021-10-26 NV_\n----\nquick review, my understanding is:\n * thrombocytosis\
    \ is a finding\n * ET is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that causes thrombocytosis\n\
    \ * ET was only recently classified as neoplasm by WHO so confusion may arise\
    \ from older pubs\n * ET can be caused by somatic or germline mutations in a few\
    \ different genes ([OMIM summary](https://www.omim.org/entry/187950))\nWe have\
    \ some confusion at the moment about whether a term for familial thrombocytosis/thrombocythemia\
    \ should exist and how it should be placed.\nORDO has two classes:\n * essential\
    \ thrombocythemia http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_3318 *Essential thrombocythemia\
    \ (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN, see this term) characterized by\
    \ a sustained elevation of platelet number (> 450 x 109/L) with a tendency for\
    \ thrombosis and hemorrhage*\n* familial thrombocytosis http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_71493\
    \ *Familial thrombocytosis is a type of thrombocytosis, a sustained elevation\
    \ of platelet numbers, which affects the platelet/megakaryocyte lineage and may\
    \ create a tendency for thrombosis and hemorrhage __but does not cause myeloproliferation__*\n\
    Based on the definitions these are disjoint classes differentiated by whether\
    \ the degree of  myeloproliferation is considered neoplastic? This seems unusual.\n\
    Also: FT is linked to all 4 OMIMs in the phenotypic series for FT. ET has only\

    \ on the term Congenital intrinsic factor deficiency,  MONDO:0009852. and how\
    \ to map it to UMLS's concepts/CUIs.\nThe OMIM # (261000), GARD 3024, Orpha332\
    \ and MESH C563242 all support a match to the UMLS concept for 'intrinsic factor\
    \ deficiency\" (C1394891) \nHowever SCTID 34925000  maps to \"Megaloblastic anemia\
    \ due to inborn errors of metabolism\" which seems to be a near match, but not\
    \ the same concept. I suggest you remove this X-ref.\nWould SCTID 60504009 \"\
    Megaloblastic anemia due to congenital deficiency of intrinsic factor\" be the\
    \ better fit for this concept? Or is this more of a clinical presentation of the\
    \ \"intrinsic factor deficiency\" concept? Neither SCTID 60504009  nor the UMLS\
    \ term that it maps to C0271969 have any indication of age of onset, so \"hereditary\
    \ JUVENILE megaloblastic anemia...\" seems to make the distinction that this MONDO\
    \ concept accounts for a childhood age of onset, but the SCTID 60504009 is \"\
    congenital\" which might be an infantile/neonatal onset?  Is that biologically\
    \ relevant, Is there an adult form, too? I have no idea. NORD suggests there are\
    \ different subtypes of pernicious anemia, including an adult form, but this rabbit\
    \ trail is getting a bit complicated (https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/anemia-pernicious/)\
    \ \nFurther complicating things... OrphaNet:332 additionally maps to C0340957\
    \  \"Congenital deficiency of intrinsic factor\" (which UMLS equates with SCTID\
    \ 234361004) as well as the C1394891 term mentioned above. \nFor our purposes\
    \ at MedGen/GTR, I'm going to map this MONDO term to C1394891, since that has\
    \ the same OMIM reference. But if there is any support for getting UMLS to merge\

    **Suggested revision and reasons**\nI am having a hard time making heads or tails\
    \ of this class... but something seems off when we've got nonepidermolytic _focal_\
    \ types of a disorder as children/(great-)grandchildren of a _diffuse_ type of\

    \ this point. I don't want to make suggestions that are incorrect. \nAs OMIM describes\
    \ these disorders, they can be divided into Diffuse, focal or punctate types AND\
    \ further divided into epidermolytic or non-epidermolytic types.  I am attaching\
    \ a doc with my notes on where I think the MIM numbers might be organized in a\
    \ hierarchy, but I cannot tell which Mondo concepts or OrphaNet terms might be\
    \ direct matches to these MIM disorders. And this is ONLY considering the genetic,\
    \ isolated forms of the disorder, not ones where PPK is one feature of a broader\
    \ syndrome that are elsewhere in the Mondo tree that includes (NEPPK) MONDO:0006588;\
    \ I think it is very useful to have this \"Isolated\" PPK term, but maybe we need\
    \ to make it less specific to \"diffuse\" PPK so we can reasonably have the focal,\
    \ punctate and striate forms all grouped together meaningfully.\n[PalmoplantarKeratoderma_Notes.docx](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/files/6541771/PalmoplantarKeratoderma_Notes.docx)\n\

    This term has many children but the text def is:

    Frontonasal dysplasia caused by mutations in the ALX3 gene, encoding homeobox
    protein aristaless-like 3. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.

    I think the def should be revised to the Orphanet def:

    A group of rare bone development disorders characterized by an array of abnormalities
    affecting the eyes, forehead, and nose, and linked to midfacial dysraphia. The
    clinical picture is highly variable, but the major findings include hypertelorism,
    a broad nasal root, a large and bifid nasal tip, and widow''s peak. Occasionally,
    abnormalities can include accessory nasal tags, cleft lip, ocular abnormalities
    (coloboma, cataract, microphthalmia), conductive hearing loss, basal encephalocele
    and/or agenesis of the corpus callosum. Intellectual deficit is rare and more
    likely to occur in cases where hypertelorism is severe or where there is extra-cranial

    MONDO:0100124/NAA10-related syndrome

    **Reason for review**  (I think there is a merge in here somewhere, or maybe just
    revision of relationships)

    Orphanet uses microphthalmia, Lenz type and provides the pointers to MCOPS1 and
    MCOPS2 in OMIM (https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&Expert=568),
    suggesting that Lenz type is defined by X-linked inhertance, to which NAA10 (type
    1) and BCOR (type 2) contribute.  If that is the case, Lenz should not be a child
    of NAA10-related syndrome; only MCOPS1 should be and MONDO:0010261 should be sibling
    of MONDO:0010671

    I am not sure of the distinction between MONDO:0100124/NAA10-related syndrome
    and MONDO:0010671/microphthalmia, syndromic 1, given that both are based on NAA10.  Are

    I noticed this because  I know that a lot of DNA repair disorders cause defects

    I checked all the DNA repair disorders annotated at PomBase. There may be others...

    \ hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes\
    \ or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes.\n\

    \ Using the ClinGen lumping and splitting guidelines, the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders\

- pr3104: 'Proposed Change to Subclassifications of Hypophosphatasia

    **Mondo term (ID and Label):**

    MONDO:0007798 (adult hypophosphatasia)

    MONDO:0009428 (childhood hypophosphatasia)

    MONDO:0009427 (infantile hypophosphatasia)

    MONDO:0016606 (perinatal benign hypophosphatasia)

    **Suggested new label:**

    Currently, the above MONDO terms are subclassifications of the term hypophosphatasia
    (MONDO:0018570) and these subclasses are named based on the age of onset for hypophosphatasia
    (HPP)-associated features. Recently, the bone disorders field has been moving
    towards classifications of HPP that are based on the alleles and the severity
    of the phenotype. Therefore, the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP recommends an
    amendment for these terms.

    We would like to make the above terms obsolete and replace them with the following
    terms:

    1. Severe Hypophosphatasia

    Severe hypophosphatasia is a rare, severe form of hypophosphatasia characterized
    by infantile rickets without elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity
    and a wide range of clinical manifestations due to hypomineralization. Individuals
    often present with these features in infancy or in the perinatal period.

    2. Moderate Hypophosphatasia

    Moderate hypophosphatasia is a rare, moderate form of hypophosphatasia characterized
    by defective mineralization of bone and/or teeth, premature loss of teeth with
    intact roots, and reduced serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Individuals
    can present with this form of hypophosphatasia in infancy, childhood, or adulthood.

    3. Mild Hypophosphtasia

    Mild hypophosphatasia is the most common form of hypophosphatasia characterized
    by low alkaline phosphatase, unspecific clinical signs, and typically presents
    in individuals in adulthood.

    delay in language, social skills and fine and gross motor development, intellectual
    disability, hypotonia, microcephaly, seizures/epilepsy), facial dysmorphism (deep
    set eyes, large ears, hypoplastic vermillion of upper lip, large mouth with widely
    spaced teeth), feeding problems often due to chewing difficulties and aversion
    to food with certain textures, failure to thrive, gastrointestinal abnormalities
    (reflux or vomiting) and strabismus. The disease is caused by mutations in the
    gene SSR4 (Xq28).

    - [x] MONDO:0011257 - def: MPI-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked
    glycosylation, characterized by cyclic vomiting, profound hypoglycemia, failure
    to thrive, liver fibrosis, gastrointestinal complications (protein-losing enteropathy
    with hypoalbuminaemia, life-threatening intestinal bleeding of diffuse origin),
    and thrombotic events (protein C and S deficiency, low anti-thrombine III levels),
    whereas neurological development and cognitive capacity is usually normal. The
    clinical course is variable even within families. The disease is caused by loss
    of function of the gene MPI (15q24.1).

    - [x] MONDO:0011291 - def: A form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation
    characterized by feeding problems, mild-to-moderate neurologic involvement with
    hypotonia, poor head control, developmental delay, ataxia, strabismus, and seizures,
    ranging from febrile convulsions to epilepsy. Retinal degeneration has also been
    reported. A minority of patients show other manifestations, particularly intestinal
    (such as protein-losing enteropathy) and liver involvement. The disease is caused
    by loss of function mutations of the gene ALG6 (1p31.3).

    - [x] MONDO:0011629 - def: MOGS-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked
    glycosylation characterized by generalized hypotonia, craniofacial dysmorphism
    (prominent occiput, short palpebral fissures, long eyelashes, broad nose, high
    arched palate , retrognathia), hypoplastic genitalia, seizures, feeding difficulties,
    hypoventilation, severe hypogammaglobulinemia with generalized edema, and increased
    resistance to particular viral infections (particularly to enveloped viruses).
    The disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene MOGS (2p13.1).

    syndrome (MONDO:0014195) to microcornea-myopic chorioretinal atrophy to reflect
    the published genotypic and phenotypic data.   '

    delay in language, social skills and fine and gross motor development, intellectual
    disability, hypotonia, microcephaly, seizures/epilepsy), facial dysmorphism (deep
    set eyes, large ears, hypoplastic vermillion of upper lip, large mouth with widely
    spaced teeth), feeding problems often due to chewing difficulties and aversion
    to food with certain textures, failure to thrive, gastrointestinal abnormalities
    (reflux or vomiting) and strabismus. The disease is caused by mutations in the
    gene SSR4 (Xq28).

    - [x] MONDO:0011257 - def: MPI-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked
    glycosylation, characterized by cyclic vomiting, profound hypoglycemia, failure
    to thrive, liver fibrosis, gastrointestinal complications (protein-losing enteropathy
    with hypoalbuminaemia, life-threatening intestinal bleeding of diffuse origin),
    and thrombotic events (protein C and S deficiency, low anti-thrombine III levels),
    whereas neurological development and cognitive capacity is usually normal. The
    clinical course is variable even within families. The disease is caused by loss
    of function of the gene MPI (15q24.1).

    \ in OMIM associated with a single gene, and also a direct subClassOf relation\
    \ with an exactMatch in OMIM associated with a single, different gene. Essentially,\
    \ this creates a structure in MONDO that suggests that a condition can be a subclass\
    \ of a different condition with a totally different genetic context. In some cases\
    \ (generally obvious by the label on the condition) this is due to an inaccurate\
    \ exactMatch with an OMIM term. In other cases, (again, typically fairly obvious)\
    \ this appears due to an inappropriate subClassOf relation. \nThis came up for\
    \ us in context of reviewing ClinGen curations on Ehlers-Danlos. The issue we\
    \ ran into was that curations linked to EDS type 2 were showing up as a subclass\
    \ of curations linked to EDS type 1, when the two are associated with different\
    \ genes (COL51A, COL51B). This led to running the query that generated the above\
    \ list to see if there were additional, related inconsistencies.\nOf these, there\
    \ are some that are clear issues that ought to be fixed, (the EDS example). Others\
    \ might be a bit more complicated due to OMIM's using the first term in a series\
    \ as representative of the overall phenotype. (MONDO:0010168, Usher syndrome type\
    \ 1, for example). \nPlease let me know if you would like additional information\

    Freire-Maia odontotrichomelic syndrome MONDO:0023191 and odontotrichomelic syndrome
    MONDO:001011

    **Reason for deprecation**

    Based on identifiers and terms, I am not certain there is any distinction.

    https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Expert=2723 provides https://omim.org/entry/273400
    as a cross reference.  OMIM provides odontotrichomelic syndrome as an alternate
    name, with Freire-Maia as the first to report

    **Term to be merged with**

    not sure which to retain as primary.  I guess odontotrichomelic syndrome MONDO:001011
    because it is used more often

    \ cerebral malformations due to abnormalities in MTOR pathway genes\n**Synonyms**\n\
    **Definition (free text, please give PubMed ID, if applicable, in format PMID:#######)**\n\
    The disease caused by mosaic gain-of-function (GoF) several genes in the MTOR\
    \ pathway (MTOR, PIK3CA, PIK3R2 and AKT3) are functionally the same despite significant\
    \ phenotypic variability. These GoF variants result in overgrowth due to an over-activation\
    \ of key genes in this pathway (PMID: 27860216). The phenotypic variability is\
    \ generally attributed to the mosaic fraction and affected tissue types. For example,\
    \ macrocephaly is noted if the variant is identified in the brain, but non symmetric\
    \ overgrowth of that limb is noted when the variant is only present in the affected\
    \ limb. The pathologies of the affected tissue often reveal similar characteristics\
    \ such as cellular overgrowth. However, this is not always the case especially\
    \ with focal cortical dysplasia. At times the characteristics pathologies are\
    \ not present in the tissue but sampling biases are an issue. FCD resections often\
    \ involve a very small area and so a very small amount of tissue is available\
    \ for pathology and it is not guaranteed that lesional tissue is sent. Therefore,\
    \ having a single disease term which can encompass the phenotypic variability\
    \ yet provide a unifying molecular diagnosis name makes sense given the common\
    \ functional mechanism. PMID: 22729224, PMID: 31441589, PMID: 22729223, PMID:\

    \ in OMIM associated with a single gene, and also a direct subClassOf relation\
    \ with an exactMatch in OMIM associated with a single, different gene. Essentially,\
    \ this creates a structure in MONDO that suggests that a condition can be a subclass\
    \ of a different condition with a totally different genetic context. In some cases\
    \ (generally obvious by the label on the condition) this is due to an inaccurate\
    \ exactMatch with an OMIM term. In other cases, (again, typically fairly obvious)\
    \ this appears due to an inappropriate subClassOf relation. \nThis came up for\
    \ us in context of reviewing ClinGen curations on Ehlers-Danlos. The issue we\
    \ ran into was that curations linked to EDS type 2 were showing up as a subclass\
    \ of curations linked to EDS type 1, when the two are associated with different\
    \ genes (COL51A, COL51B). This led to running the query that generated the above\
    \ list to see if there were additional, related inconsistencies.\nOf these, there\
    \ are some that are clear issues that ought to be fixed, (the EDS example). Others\
    \ might be a bit more complicated due to OMIM's using the first term in a series\
    \ as representative of the overall phenotype. (MONDO:0010168, Usher syndrome type\
    \ 1, for example). \nPlease let me know if you would like additional information\

    **Bug/Typo/Error description**

    The adenoids  are the superior-most of the tonsils. Therefore, tonsillitis and
    adenoiditis are not exact synoynyms. I am not sure if it is a good idea to subclass
    according to each tonsil because typical acute bouts of tonsillitis affect multiple
    tonsils. We should consult the ENT literature for classifications.

    Early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (EOAD) is a progressive dementia

    A degenerative disease of the brain that causes gradual loss of memory, judgment,

    (more than 2 people in a family have AD). When Alzheimer disease begins before
    60 or 65 years of age (early-onset AD) about 60% of the cases are familial (also
    known as Early-onset familial AD). These cases appear to be inherited in an autosomal
    dominant manner.

    "Crisponi syndrome" (aka cold induced sweating syndrome 1),  "cold induced sweating
    syndrome 2" and "cold induced sweating syndrome 3." However, "Crisponi syndrome"
    is given as a synonym for this parent term.

    Can we clarify where "Crisponi syndrome" belongs? It is a synonymous term for
    broad parent, or the preferred name CISS1?

    Also, OMIM 617055 now uses ''PERCHING Syndrome" as the preferred name for CISS3
    (and CISS3 is a former name), so this should probably be updated in the synonyms.'

- pr2371: 'Change label for MONDO:0014567 (GPT2)

    The current label for MONDO:0014567 is "postnatal microcephaly-infantile hypotonia-spastic
    diplegia-dysarthria-intellectual disability syndrome". Upon discussion with the
    ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert panel, which is curating the gene
    for this disorder (GPT2), we request your consideration of changing the label
    to "Glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 deficiency". This is a more general term
    that will encompass any additional clinical symptoms found in patients with deleterious
    variants in GPT2, e.g. Ouyang et al, 2019 (PMID:31471722) expanded the phenotype
    to include short stature.

    In addition, the label "Glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 deficiency" is consistent
    with the label for the condition in IEMbase.org (see http://iembase.org/nosology/store/docs/table_s1___well_characterized_inborn_errors_of_metabolism_9282018.pdf
    )

    "Postnatal microcephaly-infantile hypotonia-spastic diplegia-dysarthria-intellectual
    disability syndrome" could be added as a synonym, along with the current synonym
    "mental retardation, autosomal recessive 49" from OMIM.

    Thanks for your help!

- pr2316: 'Consider annotation prop to distinguish disease grouping class vs disease
    entity

    It would be useful if MONDO included a way to distinguish between a disease entity
    and a disease grouping.  Currently the only way to do this is to check for subclasses/types
    of a disease; however, this results in missing valid diseases (see Huntington

    I see the parent term mitochondrial complex I deficiency, nuclear type covers

    represented by OMIM 252010 and has a unique genetic etiology (NDUFS4); the OMIM

    should be a separate child for "mitochondrial complex I deficiency, nuclear type

    Also, since these are nuclear-type mitochondrial deficiencies with multiple genetic

    go in the hierarchy under "syndromic neurometabolic disease with X-linked intellectual
    disability? Just from checking a few of the entries on the OMIM PS, it looks like

    Related to #1764 and https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/pull/1915

    From @cmungall:

    Do a review of ''spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia'' in mondo

    There are a a lot slurped from OMIM that are not classified under ''spondyloepiphyseal
    dysplasia'', e.g

    ```

    id: MONDO:0032885

    name: spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Isidor-Toutain type

    synonym: "SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, ISIDOR-TOUTAIN TYPE; SEMDIST" RELATED
    [OMIM:618728]

    xref: OMIM:618728 {source="MONDO:equivalentTo"}

    is_a: MONDO:0003847 {source="OMIM:618728"} ! Mendelian disease

    ```

    I recommend closing this and making a ticket to review ''spondyloepimetaphyseal
    dysplasia'' classification, ensure classification is complete, and fold the proposed
    merge into this.

    **Question:**

    There is not a generic ''spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia'' class in Mondo, do we
    want one?

    **Question:**

    `MONDO_0011261 spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Nishimura type` and  `MONDO_0032835
    spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, nishimura type` are closing related in name.

    Should they be merged?

    They correspond to two separate OMIM entries though:

    Mondo ID | Mondo Label | OMIM ID | OMIM Label

    -- | -- | -- | --

    MONDO_0011261 | spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Nishimura type | OMIM:602611 | SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL

    \ little to no family history of the condition. Approximately 3-5% of colon cancer\
    \ is considered 'hereditary' and is thought to be caused by an inherited predisposition\
    \ tocolon cancer that is passed down through a family in an autosomal dominant\
    \ or autosomal recessive manner. In some of these families, the underlying genetic\

    \ have a significant family history of the condition but have no identifiable\
    \ mutation in a gene known to cause a hereditary predisposition to colon cancer.\

    Definition (free text, please give PubMed ID, if applicable, in format PMID:#######):
    The term "AP-4 deficiency syndrome" is often used in literature to describe genetic
    disorders associated with the "AP4 genes", AP4B1, AP4E1, AP4M1, and AP4S1. The
    phenotypes observed in individuals with genetic variants in these genes are often
    complex and include ID, spastic paraplegia, microcephaly, brain abnormalities,
    and seizures. The ClinGen ID/Autism GCEP would like to request the term "AP-4
    deficiency syndrome" to encompass the complexity of phenotypes associated with
    variants in these four genes. PMIDs: 30543385, 29193663, 32171285, 29430868

    Congenital Myopathy Related to TTN

    Definition (free text, please give PubMed ID, if applicable, in format PMID:#######)

    TTN-Related Myopathy is a disorder of the musculoskeletal system caused by pathogenic
    variants in the TTN gene encoding the titin protein expressed in striated muscle.
    These variants are associated with a variety of overlapping congenital and adult-onset
    myopathies characterized by non-progressive or progressive neck, axial, and limb
    weakness, joint contractures, early-onset respiratory insufficiency, facial weakness,
    congenital cardiac anomalies and/or early-onset dilated cardiomyopathy. Histologic
    findings on skeletal muscle biopsy reveal a wide range of structural abnormalities
    and can include increased internalized and central nuclei, minicores, and dystrophic
    changes (PMID:27854229 and PMID:29691892).

    Parent term (use OLS, or your favorite ontology browser):

    MONDO:0017939 (classic multiminicore myopathy)

    Comment: In the absence of evidence supporting distinct differences in molecular
    mechanisms between the associated disease entities, as well as considerable phenotypic
    overlap, these entities can be considered part of a clinical spectrum of TTN-related
    myopathy.

    It also has an exact synonym of patterned dystrophy of retinal pigment epithelium
    which makes it hard to distinguish from MONDO:0018973

    \ Why is there a need to introduce a new name?\n3. familial colorectal cancer\
    \ => Here, we have made a modelling mistake. There is a big difference between\
    \ Colorectal cancer, somatic and familial colorectal cancer (the former means\
    \ that a mutation occurs in colorectal tissue, and the latter implies that a mutation\
    \ is transmitted in the germline). The problem appears to be that this OMIM entry\
    \ includes genes that are of both categories (https://omim.org/entry/114500).\
    \ As far as I can see, FLCN has never been implicated in the familial form, and\
    \ the OMIM page states: Nahorski et al. (2010) did not find any germline mutations\
    \ in the FLCN gene among 50 patients with familial nonsyndromic colorectal cancer.\

    likely along a spectrum of disease. Heterozygous variants in GJB2 have been reported
    in individuals with nonsyndromic hearing loss, palmoplantar keratoderma with deafness,
    and keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome. Through our curation, however, we
    were unable to discern differences in molecular mechanism between these diseases
    in cases with reported GJB2 variants. We suggest a broader term be created to
    encompass this spectrum of disease.

    ## Preferred term label

    Hearing loss with skin disease

    ## Synonyms

    (e.g., Absent spleen)

    ## Textual definition

    Nonsyndromic deafness, keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome, and palmoplantar
    keratoderma with deafness have all been associated with autosomal dominant variants
    in GJB2. Reported cases share hearing loss as a feature, therefore it is likely
    that these phenotypes exist along a spectrum of the same disease, differing in
    severity of skin phenotypes.

    ## Suggested parent term

    Disease with diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma as a major feature (MONDO:0017669)

    ## Attribution

    If you would like a nanoattribution, please indicate your ORCID id

    name: progressive bulbar palsy

    def: "Progressive bulbar palsy involves the brain stem. The brain stem is the
    part of the brain needed for swallowing, speaking, chewing, and other functions.
    Signs and symptoms of progressive bulbar palsy include difficulty swallowing,
    weak jaw and facial muscles, progressive loss of speech, and weakening of the
    tongue. Additional symptoms include less prominent weakness in the arms and legs,
    and outbursts of laughing or crying (called emotional lability). Progressive bulbar
    palsy is considered a variant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Many
    people with progressive bulbar palsy later develop ALS. While there is no cure
    for progressive bulbar palsy or for ALS, doctors can treat symptoms." [https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10928/progressive-bulbar-palsy]

    \ way to reference this issues.\nI'm using the MONDO ontology json from obofoundry\
    \ downloaded at 26.09.2019\nI found 4 cases where a single xref maps to multiple\
    \ MONDO terms (presented here in json like form):\n```{json}\n{\n  \"HP:0001651\"\
    : [\n    \"MONDO:0015661\",\n    \"MONDO:0004823\"\n  ],\n  \"HP:0000010\": [\n\

    \    \"MONDO:0025085\",\n    \"MONDO:0006011\"\n  ],\n  \"HP:0001941\": [\n  \
    \  \"MONDO:0006022\",\n    \"MONDO:0041261\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nSpecifically:\n - `MONDO:0015661`\
    \ and  `MONDO:0004823` are both the same as `HP:0001651` (semantically) however\
    \ are found in different places at the ontology tree. Also, `MONDO:0004823` should\
    \ be labeled with `Orphanet:1666`.\n-  `HP:0000010` - is neither `MONDO:0001650`\
    \ nor `MONDO:0005247` as it is recurrent. I couldn't find a suitable alternative\
    \ in HPO. Medically, `MONDO:0001650` should be a descendant of  `MONDO:0005247`\
    \ as it is an infection of a bladder. This will solve another placement issue\
    \ of  `MONDO:0001777` found under both of these.\n-  `MONDO:0006011` includes\
    \ both viral hepatitis in humans and animals - `MESH:D006524`, `MESH:D006525`,\
    \ `MONDO:0025085` is exactly `MESH:D006524` (animals). I'm not sure how and if\
    \ this can be resolved.\n- `MONDO:0006022` is exactly `HP:0001941` while `MONDO:0041261`\
    \ can also potentially include alkalosis and so shouldn't refer to `HP:0001941`.\n\

    \ label\nActinopathy\nNote: I see the term \u201Cqualitative or quantitative defects\
    \ of alpha-actin\u201D (MONDO:0016193) exists and this may be the same disease\
    \ entity I am trying to create but it lacks many details. If that is the case,\
    \ then I would suggest renaming the entry to Actinopathy, the name currently used\
    \ in the field, and changing the parent/child terms as described below. \n## Synonyms\n\
    actin myopathy, ACTA1 disease\n## Textual definition\nActinopathy is a disorder\
    \ of the musculoskeletal system that covers a wide spectrum of phenotypes and\
    \ is caused by pathogenic variants in the skeletal muscle \u03B1-actin gene (ACTA1).\
    \ These variants lead to a variety of overlapping adult onset and congenital myopathies\
    \ characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, myopathic face, respiratory dysfunction,\
    \ and rarely cardiac involvement. Specific skeletal muscle structural lesions\
    \ visible on muscle biopsy include actin accumulations, nemaline and intranuclear\
    \ bodies, fiber-type disproportion, cores, caps, dystrophic features and zebra\
    \ bodies. Disorders associated with ACTA1 pathogenic variants can have autosomal\
    \ dominant (90%) or recessive (10%) inheritance.\nPMIDs in support of this term\
    \ request: 22825594\n## Suggested parent terms\ncongenital myopathy\nqualitative\
    \ or quantitative protein defects in neuromuscular diseases\n## Suggested Child\
    \ terms for collapse under new term\nnemaline myopathy 3 (MONDO:0008070)\ncongenital\
    \ fiber-type disproportion myopathy (MONDO:0009711)\ncongenital myopathy with\
    \ excess of thin filaments (MONDO:0020342)\nprogressive scapulohumeroperoneal\
    \ distal myopathy (MONDO:0014800)\ncap myopathy (MONDO:0015753)\nzebra body myopathy\
    \ (MONDO:0019949)\nComment: The most penetrant phenotype among all of the actinopathy\
    \ disease entities is muscular weakness. While nemaline myopathy is the most common\
    \ presentation, several other myopathies have been reported in association with\
    \ ACTA1 mutations. The absence of clearly defined and/or distinct differences\
    \ in molecular mechanism, coupled with noted phenotypic variability (both intra-\
    \ and inter-familial) for individual variants, indicates that these entities are\
    \ part of the same clinical spectrum.\n## Attribution"

    It would be useful if MONDO included a way to distinguish between a disease entity

    of a disease; however, this results in missing valid diseases (see Huntington
    disease and Cystic Fibrosis).  We regularly add a check that all diseases with
    an OMIM equivalent are disease entities, but a more formal way to determine this
    would be useful for analyses and application views.'

    \ revised definition:_ The disorder is characterized by thrombocytopenia of varying\

    \ due to germ line variations in the RUNX1, ETV6 or ANKRD26 genes (PMID: 28600339).\
    \ This definition is provided by the experts in the Clingen Myeloid Malignancy\
    \ Variant Curation Expert Panel. (https://clinicalgenome.org/affiliation/50034/).\
    \ \nReason for request: The ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert\
    \ Panel requests that the term associated with MONDO:0011071 be edited as \u201C\
    hereditary thrombocytopenia and hematologic cancer predisposition syndrome\u201D\
    \ (current term: hereditary thrombocytopenia with normal platelets and hematologic\
    \ cancer predisposition syndrome). This request is based on the evidence that\
    \ individuals with germ line variants in the RUNX1, ETV6 or ANKRD26 genes may\
    \ have varying severity of thrombocytopenia and associated platelet defects, along\
    \ with a predisposition to hematologic malignancies. Therefore, the \u201Cnormal\
    \ platelets\u201D in the current term label has to be removed.  \nMoreover, we\
    \ would like to keep this revised term as the parent and suggest child terms incorporating\
    \ each of the 3 genes that cause this condition. We ask that the definition and\
    \ synonyms associated with this parent term be removed as they would be appropriate\
    \ for one of the newly created child terms: hereditary thrombocytopenia and hematological\
    \ cancer predisposition syndrome associated with RUNX1. I will open a separate\
    \ issue (NTR) requesting the adding of child terms. At this time, we don\u2019\
    t have any synonym suggestions for this term, since this nomenclature is not in\

    |ERROR|duplicate_definition|Usher syndrome type 1C [MONDO:0010171]|definition
    [IAO:0000115]|Usher syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by sensorineural
    hearing loss or deafness and progressive vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa
    . Sensorineural hearing means it is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear .
    Retinitis pigmentosa is an eye disease that affects the layer of light-sensitive
    tissue at the back of the eye ( the retina ). Vision loss occurs as the light-sensing

    [IAO:0000115]|Usher syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by sensorineural
    hearing loss or deafness and progressive vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa
    . Sensorineural hearing means it is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear .
    Retinitis pigmentosa is an eye disease that affects the layer of light-sensitive
    tissue at the back of the eye ( the retina ). Vision loss occurs as the light-sensing
    cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Night vision loss begins first, followed
    by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral) vision, that can enlarge
    and merge to produce tunnel vision (loss of all peripheral vision). In some cases,
    vision is further impaired by clouding of the lens of the eye ( cataracts ). Three
    major types of Usher syndrome have been described - types I , II , and III . The
    different typesare distinguished by their severity and the age when signs and
    symptoms appear. All three types are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner
    . Treatment for the hearing loss may include hearing aids or surgery for a cochlear
    implant . Vitamin A palmitate is useful for treating the vision loss in people
    with Usher syndrome type II.|

    **Suggested revision and reasons**

    This term should be moved out from under infantile epilepsy syndrome (MONDO:0020071)
    and generalised epilepsy (MONDO:0005579) and placed directly under epilepsy (MONDO:0005027).
    This comes at the request of ClinGen''s Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel. Please
    let me or @ErinRiggs know if you have any questions! Thank you!'
- pr794: 'Merge request for RASopathy + Noonan Syndrome and Noonan-related Syndrome

    For new term requests, please provide the following information:

    There are two terms

    [MONDO:0021060](https://monarchinitiative.org/disease/MONDO:0021060) (RASopathy)
    with no equivalent ids

    and

    [MONDO:0020297](https://monarchinitiative.org/disease/MONDO:0020297) (Noonan Syndrome
    and Noonan-Related Syndromes) which originates from [Orphanet:98733](http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=en&Expert=98733)

    The ClinGen consortium''s RASopathy Variant Curation Expert Panel relies on MONDO
    with their tooling to perform expert curations in this domain. When curation users
    lookup ''RASopathy'' in MONDO they get the first MONDO id above.  However, the
    end result needs to be shared in ClinVar. Since ClinVar is driven by MedGen and
    not MONDO, they map the "Orphanet:98733" term to "RASopathy" as an equivalent.  ClinVar
    requires the submitters to use MedGen or Orphanet or OMIM or MeSH ids during submission.
    The ClinGen tooling is designed to rely on MONDO''s equivalent ids to find a match
    that is suitable for ClinVar.

    When we hit situations like this, we think it would be best for the overall community
    to be able to work with the resource that is able to provide the best solution.
    We request that MONDO merge these two terms as they appear to be equivalent or
    make the argument for keeping them separate and thus requesting Orphanet or OMIM
    to create an equivalent term that would allow better harmony with downstream system''s
    like ClinVar and ClinGen.

    Please let us know if this is possible.'

    Neonatal diabetes, congenital sensorineural hearing loss and congenital cataracts

    ## Textual definition

    Neonatal diabetes, congenital sensorineural hearing loss and congenital cataracts
    is characterized by the three primary phenotypes of neonatal diabetes, congenital
    sensorineural hearing loss and congenital cataracts. Cases have reported additional
    varying phenotypes, including optic atrophy, hypothyroidism, severe neonatal hypotonia
    in males, developmental delay, facial abnormalities, and a few other more rare
    phenotypes. The severity and congenital onset of the phenotypes distinguish these
    patients from Wolfram-like syndrome patients. (Sources: PMIDs 28468959, 27217304)

    ## Suggested parent term

    syndromic genetic deafness (MONDO:0019589)

    ## Additional information

    This phenotype has been found in association with de novo heterozygous variants
    in WFS1. The mechanism for disease has been proposed as gain-of-function by De
    Franco et al 2017 (PMID:28468959). The mechanism for disease and severity of phenotype
    distinguish these affected individuals from Wolfram-like syndrome patients, which
    have also been linked to heterozygous WFS1 variants (non-de novo). '

- pr451: 'Request to change main term of MONDO:0011652

    Hello,

    I would like to request that the main term for MONDO:0011652 be changed from monosomy
    22q13 to Phelan McDermid syndrome. This syndrome was first recognized in individuals
    with larger, multi-gene deletions at 22q13, which is how it got the original name.  Deletions
    or LOF of the gene SHANK3 causes what we now describe as Phelan-McDermid syndrome.
    The term "Phelan-McDermid" describes both groups - individuals with the deletion
    and individuals with sequence variants within SHANK3, but "monosomy 22q13" describes
    only the former group, not the latter. Monosomy 22q13 could potentially be kept
    as a synonym of this term or it could be made into a child of this term.

    Please direct any questions regarding this change to @erinriggs.

    - [ ] [aplasia cutis congenita recessive](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/755/aplasia-cutis-congenita-recessive)
    - is this different from autosomal recessive? Both classes exist in GARD and in
    MONDO, I can''t find anything about just the recessive version online though.

    \ of this gene we find that the disease entities is broader in nature than the\

    \ parent term. \n## List of Disease Groups\nOrphan/ child terms for collapse into\
    \ broader parent term:\n1. Lujan-Fryns syndrome, aka. X-linked intellectual disability\
    \ with marfanoid habitus (MONDO:0010655)\n2. Ohdo syndrome, X-linked aka. blepharophimosis-intellectual\

    \ aka. FG syndrome 1 (MONDO:0010590)\n## Synonyms\n(e.g., Absent spleen)\n## Textual\
    \ definition\nSubtypes of the heterogeneous, eponymously named Lujan-Fryns syndrome,\
    \ X-linked Ohdo syndrome, and Optiz-Kaveggia/ FG syndrome are caused by mutations\
    \ in the gene MED12. The common and most penetrant phenotype shared amongst these\
    \ disease entities is intellectual disability, with dysgenesis or agenesis of\
    \ the corpus callosum, blepharophimosis, and marfanoid habitus  having variable\
    \ phenotypic expressivity.  \n## Suggested parent term\nMED12-related intellectual\
    \ disability syndrome\n## List of references supporting\nThe PMIDs in support\
    \ of this collapse are: 28369444, 28544239, 24123922,   28794916\n## Analysis\
    \ of how other disease IDs relate:\nThe most penetrant phenotype among all of\
    \ the MED12 related disease entities is intellectual disability; but due to the\
    \ absence of clearly defined and/or distinct differences in molecular mechanism,\
    \ coupled with noted phenotypic variability (both intra- and inter-familial) these\
    \ entities appear to be part of a broader disease entity.\nAs an additional measure\
